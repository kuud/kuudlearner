# kuudlearner  ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kuud/kuudlearner?style=flat-square) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C++-hotpink?style=flat-square)
*Prototyped by **x_k0tori**. Continued by **kuud** until February 2023*
<br />

**kuudlearner** is a repository housing an integrated version of **CHack**. \
This is a fully functional osu! cheat, which has now been released to help others learn how easy it is to 'hack' on osu!

<br />


## kuudlearner - The Cheat     ![osu!Bancho](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-Detected-red)
A powerful and efficient osu! cheat which aims to bring your gameplay to a new level. 



- **Aim Assist** (integrated megumi AA)
- FL Remover
- CS & AR Modifier 
- Timewarp
- Configs

<br />

Aside from timewarp and megu-shit type aim assist, the rest of the program works well and has no problems. \
\
*If you know how to bypass osu!auth yourself, you can easily make this undetected. Again, this is no longer maintained and has been released open-source, I recommend only using it as reference for beginners.*

### COM Wrapper 

The COM Wrapper used in this build is actively used in the newer versions of osu!auth (anti-cheat) and has many similarities. 

Basically, the COM Wrapper allows the anticheat or cheat to communicate with the C# part of the game through Reflection.

#### End Notes 
###### Do not paste this cheat. As it is now released & open-source, it is highly likely this cheat is detected into oblivion and will stay detected until it goes through rigourous refurbishment.

###### If you see any cheat with a similar layout, AVOID it at all cost.

###### This is meant to be an educational product.
