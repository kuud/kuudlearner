*Originally created by **x_k0tori**. Maintained by **kuud** until September 2022*
<br />

**kuudlearner** is a repository housing an integrated version of **CeaiHack**. \
This is a fully functional osu! cheat, which has now been released to help others learn how easy it is to 'hack' on osu!

<br />


## CeaiHack - The Cheat     ![osu!Bancho](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-Detected-red)
A powerful and efficient osu! cheat which aims to bring your gameplay to a new level. 



- **Aim Assist** (integrated megumin shit AA)
- FL Remover
- CS & AR Modifier 
- Timewarp
- Configs

<br />

Aside from timewarp and megu-shit type aim assist, the rest of the program works well and has no problems. \
\
*If you know how to bypass osu!auth yourself, you can easily make this undetected. Again, this is no longer maintained and has been released open-source, I recommend only using it as reference for beginners.*

### COM Wrapper 

The COM Wrapper used in this build is actively used in the newer versions of osu!auth (anti-cheat) and has many similarities. 

Basically, the COM Wrapper allows the anticheat or cheat to communicate with the C# part of the game through Reflection.

### IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE MAINTAINER

I've been notified by my friend, x_k0tori, of this repo, and he would want to talk to you. Please add him over discord at x_k0tori#0996 and have a small talk. THANK YOU!
